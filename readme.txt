This plugin is meant to monitor your domainnames and warn you before they expire.

== Description ==

BMRE Domain Monitor is built to keep an eye on the domains you add.

It checks the expiration date and warns you if a domain will expire in 30 days or less (both through email and in the admin interface)

It also has the feature (optional) to suggest domains that are similar to the ones you've added and that are still available.

DISCLAIMER: Do not ONLY trust this plugin for your domains. It works well but I can not be held responsible if something should go wrong and your domain does actually expire.
